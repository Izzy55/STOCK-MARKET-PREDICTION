# STOCK-MARKET-PREDICTION
Stock Market Prediction Project
Predicting Stock Market prices can be incredibly difficult.  There are no consistent patterns in stock market data that allow an analyst or investor to model stock prices over time with near-perfect accuracy.  This is due to the high number of rapidly changing and difficult to forecast factors upon which the movement of stock prices can depend.  The current advances in machine learning techniques and algorithms have made their implementation for prediction of stock prices a popular area of research.  The results have been promising and several different techniques and algorithms have been used.  In this project I have used four different time series machine learning models for predicting future rises or falls in stock market price movements.  My initial forecast was predicted using an LSTM model that was then compared to a liner regression model, decision tree model, and finally an XGBoost model.  As a final step, the one day moving average was also determined using a standard averaging technique and the exponential moving average.  The purpose of this was to compare the long-range prediction accuracy to single step accuracy.
